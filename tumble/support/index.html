    <h2>Game Mechanics</h2>
    <p>Tumble offers a distinctive puzzle experience, characterized by a dynamic game board that rotates as tiles cascade downwards, merging seamlessly. Strategize your moves to achieve the highest score by skillfully combining tiles and earning points with each successful merge.</p>

<section id="how-to-play">
    <h2>How to Play</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Rotate the board using a drag gesture, either clockwise or counterclockwise.</li>
        <li>Watch as tiles cascade downwards, settling at the bottom of the board.</li>
        <li>Tiles with the same numbers combine upon collision, merging into larger tiles.</li>
        <li>Earn points with each successful merge. Larger merges yield larger points adding to your score.</li>
        <li>The game concludes when the board reaches its maximum capacity, leaving no available moves to continue.</li>
    </ul>
